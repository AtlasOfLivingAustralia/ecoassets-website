    "text": "Core Features\nImprovements to Data Pipelines EcoAssets will develop pipelines that offer standard views of the biodiversity component of data collected during TERN and IMOS field programmes for aggregation with ALA data streams.\nAggregation of Similar Data Partners will deliver and maintain high-value national data products that will serve as reference assets and a baseline for future environmental assessment. Data assets include species distribution, monitoring activity and growth in biodiversity knowledge.\nAlignment of Data Services The newly aggregated data assets will provide a single set of data for major environmental products from the NCRIS infrastructures. This collection will feature standardised metadata, spatial and temporal units and other facets to support SoE reporting. The data assets will add significant value to future SoE reports (produced every 5 years), and other areas such as environmental accounting and impact assessments.\nData Principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Data linkages and summary formats will provide easy-to-access information on indicators and trends. Data pipelines developed will enable future continuous updates and integration of new data from partners."
